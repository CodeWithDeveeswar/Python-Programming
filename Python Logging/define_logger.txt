A logger is a tool used to record messages from your program while it runs.
It helps you debug, monitor, and maintain your code more effectively.
It's part of Python's built-in `logging` module.

Limitations of using print()
----------------------------
❌ You can't set log levels (e.g., info vs error)
❌ You can't redirect output easily to a file
❌ You can't filter messages (e.g., show only errors)
❌ No timestamps unless you manually add them
❌ No format control
